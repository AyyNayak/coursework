# Coursework
This coursework is designed for you to get a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms. This coursework assumes that you have knowledge in coding, but it does not assume that you have knowledge around LinkedLists, Binary Trees, Sorting algorithms or related. Therefore, it is designed to build up your skills in these topics from level zero.

## Notes
- Each exercise could take you up to 1 hours. Total duration estimation is 30 hours.
- These solutions are writen in Java, but you will be able to use your language of preference if you ever decide to do an interview.
